This is the gridium project created by Vincent Tomie

The total time taken for this project was 1.5 hours not including the creation of this README

The project uses Selenium Webdriver with Python to crawl the tidal website on Google Chrome utilzing the Chrome Webdriver.

Due to the nature of this project I felt no need to use data analysis tools such as pandas/numpy as there was only minor date conversions.
